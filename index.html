     <p class="left">Gaming refers to playing electronic games, whether through consoles, computers, mobile phones<br>or another medium altogether. Gaming is a nuanced term that suggests regular gameplay,<br>possibly as a hobby. Although traditionally a solitary form of relaxation, online multiplayer video games<br>have made gaming a popular group activity as well.

     A person who is into gaming is often called<br>a gamer or hardcore gamer.</p>
